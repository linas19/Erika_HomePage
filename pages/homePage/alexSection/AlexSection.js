          Iâ€™ve been really impressed in my time working with Erika in her role
          as one of the leading developers in the Eurosport team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find Erika astute, approachable and engaging - she takes the time
          and effort to walk through implications and options for decisions we
          need to make and is a really solid trusted sounding board on technical
          feasibility and approaches to requirements needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of being a really good developer and really hard working, Erika
          is a joy to work with from a business and stakeholder engagement
          perspective and I hope to work with her again in the future.
